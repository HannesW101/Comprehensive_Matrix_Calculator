This is a Comprehensive Matrix Calculator that can perform the following functions up to a 4x4 matrix where numbers entered into matrix fields are stored as doubles:
  - Matrix Addition
  - Matrix Subtraction
  - Matrix Multiplication
  - Scaler Multiplication
  - Scaler Division
  - Determinant
  - Inverse
  - Transpose
  - Co-factors

The operations like Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication are done on 2 matrices only where the user can input the values of both matrices. The rest of the operations are all done on one matrix.
There are also error checks for matrices that are not the correct dimensions (Matrix Multiplication, Determinant, Inverse) and also for matrices that produce a 0 determinant meaning the inverse will not be able to be calculated.
All operations are done using a custom Matrix class with no built in matrix libraries and functions used. Also the functions such as Determinant and Inverse are written in a way that they are actually able to calculate matrices of any n for nxn.

Below is an example of all the operations being done and their associated errors that are also displayed:
